# GameExercise

This is my first time to make games, I tried Pong, Arkanoids, and Space Invaders. Please feel free to give advice. I am very open to get improved. 

Space Invaders is the one I took most time to make it good. For Pong and Arkanoids, I tried them to know about the gaming concepts and practise how to use SDL.
